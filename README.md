Here I will store some important projects for my PhD:
- antismash: manually run antismash on a given genome
- biolector: manually adjust the biolector output files and add information
- fermentation: work with the output of the Eppendorf bioreactors
- G001: this is the sequencing project of G001 and analysis
- mbt-collection: which MBT strains are resistant against dmDoxo
- proteomics: work with proteomics data (specifically for G001)
